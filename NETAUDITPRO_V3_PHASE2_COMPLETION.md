    try:
        # Primary: Netmiko with full feature support
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**netmiko_params)
        return net_connect
    except NetmikoException:
        # Fallback: Paramiko wrapper for compatibility
        paramiko_wrapper = ParamikoDeviceWrapper(device_client)
        return paramiko_wrapper
```

### Real-time Progress Updates
```python
def update_progress_tracking(device, completed, total, status):
    """WebSocket-based real-time progress reporting"""
    # Update global progress state
    enhanced_progress.update({...})
    
    # Emit to WebSocket clients
    socketio.emit('progress_update', progress_data)
```

### Enhanced Command Execution
```python
def execute_core_commands_on_device(connection, device_name):
    """Execute all 5 core Cisco commands with comprehensive logging"""
    for cmd_name, command in CORE_COMMANDS.items():
        output = connection.send_command(command, timeout=60)
        # Save results, log execution, track status
```
