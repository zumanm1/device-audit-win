# NetAuditPro Progress Tracking Enhancement - PRD

## 📋 Product Requirements Document

### 🎯 Executive Summary
Enhance the existing NetAuditPro application with comprehensive progress tracking that provides real-time visibility into audit execution at both router-level and stage-level granularity.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Currently, the NetAuditPro application lacks detailed progress tracking during audit execution. Users cannot see:
- Which router is currently being processed (e.g., "Router 1 of 6")
- Overall progress percentage across all routers
- Individual router stage progress (e.g., "Stage A3 of A8")
- Stage-level progress percentage for current router

### 🎯 Objectives
1. **Router-Level Progress**: Show current router index and total count with percentage
2. **Stage-Level Progress**: Show current stage within each router's 8-stage audit
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Progress updates in logs and WebUI
4. **Non-Disruptive**: Maintain all existing functionality and code structure

### 📊 Success Metrics
- Progress tracking visible in console logs
- Progress tracking visible in Raw Trace Logs
- Progress tracking accessible via API endpoints
- Zero disruption to existing audit functionality
- 100% compatibility with current 8-stage audit process

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### 📋 Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Router-Level Progress Tracking
- **Description**: Track and display current router being processed
- **Format**: "Processing router X of Y (Z.ZZ%)"
- **Example**: "Processing router 1 of 6 (16.67%)"
- **Location**: Console logs, Raw Trace Logs, WebUI

#### FR2: Stage-Level Progress Tracking  
- **Description**: Track and display current stage within router audit
- **Format**: "Stage AX of A8 (Z.ZZ%)"
- **Example**: "Stage A3 of A8 (37.50%)"
- **Location**: Console logs, Raw Trace Logs, WebUI

#### FR3: Combined Progress Display
- **Description**: Show both router and stage progress together
- **Format**: "Router X/Y (Z.ZZ%) - Stage AX/A8 (Z.ZZ%)"
- **Example**: "Router 1/6 (16.67%) - Stage A3/A8 (37.50%)"

#### FR4: Progress API Endpoints
- **Description**: Expose progress data via REST API
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/api/progress-detailed` - Detailed progress information
  - `/api/progress-summary` - Summary progress information

### 🏗️ Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- Progress tracking must not impact audit execution time by more than 1%
- Progress updates must be lightweight and non-blocking

#### NFR2: Compatibility
- Must work with existing 8-stage audit process
- Must work with legacy audit fallback
- Must maintain all existing log formats

#### NFR3: Reliability
- Progress tracking failures must not stop audit execution
- Progress data must be consistent and accurate

## 🎨 User Experience Requirements

### UX1: Console Log Enhancement
```
📍 Processing router 1 of 6 (16.67%): Cisco 2911
🚀 Starting 8-Stage Audit for Cisco 2911 (172.16.39.101)
📍 Stage A1 of A8 (12.50%): ICMP Connectivity Test for Cisco 2911
📍 Stage A2 of A8 (25.00%): SSH Connection & Authentication for Cisco 2911
```

### UX2: Raw Trace Log Enhancement
```
RAW: [18:12:15.123] [PROGRESS] [ROUTER] Processing 1/6 (16.67%): Cisco 2911
RAW: [18:12:15.124] [PROGRESS] [STAGE] A1/A8 (12.50%): ICMP Test
RAW: [18:12:16.456] [PROGRESS] [STAGE] A2/A8 (25.00%): SSH Authentication
```

### UX3: WebUI Progress Display
- Progress bars showing router and stage completion
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Progress percentage displays

## 🔄 Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Progress Tracking (High Priority)
1. Create progress tracking data structures
2. Implement router-level progress calculation
3. Implement stage-level progress calculation
4. Add progress logging functions

### Phase 2: Integration (High Priority)
1. Integrate with existing 8-stage audit process
2. Add progress updates to console logs
3. Add progress updates to Raw Trace Logs
4. Ensure compatibility with legacy audit

### Phase 3: API Enhancement (Medium Priority)
1. Create progress API endpoints
2. Add progress data to existing APIs
3. Implement WebSocket progress updates

### Phase 4: WebUI Enhancement (Low Priority)
1. Add progress bars to WebUI
2. Implement real-time progress updates
3. Add progress indicators to dashboard
