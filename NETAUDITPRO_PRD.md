## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Limitations
1. **Limited Security Scope**: Only covers AUX ports (misses Console, VTY, TTY)
2. **Single Vector Assessment**: No cross-line configuration correlation
3. **Basic Risk Scoring**: Simple 4-level risk assessment
4. **Minimal Configuration Context**: Limited service-level security insight
5. **Static Command Set**: No adaptability to evolving security requirements

### 2.2 Security Gaps Identified
From execution log analysis:
- **Console Security**: No assessment of console port configuration
- **VTY Security**: No evaluation of remote access lines
- **Service Security**: No global service security settings assessment
- **Access Control**: No access-class evaluation
- **Password Policy**: No password encryption assessment
