        "api_endpoints": ["/device_status", "/down_devices", "/enhanced_summary"]
    }
    // ... complete summary data
}
```

#### Enhanced Down Device Tracking ✅
- ✅ **Detailed Failure Tracking**: ICMP failures with timestamps

#### Placeholder Configuration Generation ✅
```bash
✅ Generated placeholder configs for down devices:
   - R1-DEVICE_DOWN.txt (ICMP ping failed to 172.16.39.101)
   - R2-DEVICE_DOWN.txt (ICMP ping failed to 172.16.39.102) 
   - R3-DEVICE_DOWN.txt (ICMP ping failed to 172.16.39.103)
   - R4-DEVICE_DOWN.txt (ICMP ping failed to 172.16.39.105)

✅ Placeholder config content includes:
   - Device identification details
   - Failure reason and timestamp
   - Recommended troubleshooting actions
   - Professional formatting
```
